## Readme

There are two files, a R script named *run_analysis.r* which performs all the work and a document named *CodeBook.md* which explains the data used and the process applied to it.

You have to download the dataset from this [site](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and extract it to the same folder containing the R script.

Set the working directory of R to the folder containing the script and run it.
